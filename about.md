## About Me
Hi, I’m Zeshui Song. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering at The Cooper Union’s Albert Nerken School of Engineering. Through completing a range of mathematics and physics courses, alongside hands-on engineering projects, I’ve built a strong foundation in problem-solving and technical design, though I am still exploring which specific field within engineering I want to pursue.

I have always been drawn to challenging problems that sit at the intersection of physics and mechanical design. This interest has led me to work on experimental apparatus for the testing and verification of fluid flow, as well as exploring machine learning algorithms that model and predict physical behavior in complex systems. These experiences have fueled my curiosity and helped me develop both practical and analytical skills, which I hope to continue applying in future research and engineering projects.
