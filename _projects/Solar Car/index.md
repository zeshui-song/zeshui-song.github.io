title: "BTHS Solar Car Team"
description: >
  In June 2020, I founded the first-ever solar car team at Brooklyn Technical High School. Over one year, I built a multidisciplinary organization of over 30 members to design and engineer a roadworthy solar vehicle from the ground up to race at the <a href="https://www.solarcarchallenge.org/challenge/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">Solar Car Challenge</a>. The project involved securing over $30,000 in technical sponsorships, forming a partnership with a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, and both learning and teaching core technical concepts within a student-led engineering team.
skills: 
  - Project Management & Leadership
  - CAD (Autodesk Inventor)
